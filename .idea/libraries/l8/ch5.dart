/*
  Copy the getName function down here and rename it as getString.
  Congratulations! You've now made a function that you can now re-use anytime
  you want to ask a user for something that should be a String, and the only
  thing you need to do now is

  String snack = getString('Hello, what snack would you like?')

  or

  String beverage = getString('Hello, what would you like to drink?')

  CHALLENGE
  I want you to create 2 more functions that behave the same way, but
  will be returning different things

  getDouble() and getInt()

  Both of these should also accept a custom String as an input.

// I'm getting lazy, so now you decide where to paste and create your functions! :)
