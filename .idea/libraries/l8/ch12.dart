/*
  What about other input types?

  YOU are now the slave of some poor human who has tasked you with calculating
  the area of a circle given the radius of a circle.

  A = pi * r * r

  Ask the user for the radius of the circle, then call your circleArea function
  and make it return the area of the circle. Print the output.

  HINT:
    For pi, you can either use 3.14 or simply import dart:math and then you
    get the variable pi that you can use directly.
