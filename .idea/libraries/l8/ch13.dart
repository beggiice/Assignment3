/*
  Same thing as in ch12, but now create these two methods as well, they also
  accept simply the radius as an input.

  circleCircumference
  sphereVolume

  The formulas are
  circleCircumference: 2 * r * pi
  sphereVolume: (4 / 3) * pi * r * r * r   (r*r*r is sometimes written r^3)

  Ask the user for the radius, call both your functions and print the answers.
